<h3 class="section__head">Complexity</h3>
<p class="section__p">The concept of complexity is central to Prospedia because the
routes to the prosperity of a society depend on firms to successfully produce
and export goods and services that require skills and knowledge that are
diverse and unique. Complexity can be measured by location (see <a
class="link--stream" href="#economic-complexity-index">Economic Complexity Index</a>), by
industry (see <a class="link--stream" href="#industry-complexity-index">Industry Complexity
Index</a>) or by export product (see <a
class="link--stream" href="#product-complexity-index">Product Complexity Index</a>).</p>

<h3 class="section__head">Complexity Outlook</h3>
<p class="section__p">Ranks the potential for a location to increase its complexity. The ranking
accounts for the level of complexity of the industries (or exports) along with
the distance of how close the productive capabilities that these products
require are to its current industries (or exports). In effect, it measures the
likelihood of different industries (or exports) appearing and the value of
their added complexity. Higher outlook values indicate “closer distance” to
more, and more complex, industries (or exports).</p>

<h3 class="section__head">Distance</h3>
<p class="section__p">A measure of a location’s ability to enter a specific industry or export, as
determined by its current productive capabilities. Also known as a capability
distance, the measure accounts for the similarity between the capabilities
required by an industry or export and the capabilities already present in a
location’s industries or exports. Where a new industry or export requires many
of the same capabilities already present in a location’s industries or exports,
the product is considered “closer” or of a shorter “distance” to acquire the
missing capabilities to produce it. New industries or exports of a further
distance require larger sets of productive capabilities that do not exist in
the location and are therefore riskier ventures or less likely to be sustained.
Thus, distance reflects the proportion of the productive knowledge necessary
for an industry or export that a location does not have. This is measured by
the proximity between industries or exports, or the probability that two
industries or exports will both be present in a location, as embodied by the
industry space and product space, respectively.</p>


<h3 class="section__head" id="economic-complexity-index">Economic Complexity Index (ECI)</h3>
<p class="section__p">A measure of the sophistication of the productive capabilities of a location
based on the diversity and exclusivity of its industries or exports. A location
with high complexity produces or exports goods and services that few other
locations produce. Highly complex locations tend to be more productive and
generate higher wages and incomes. Countries with export baskets more
sophisticated than what is expected for their income level (such as China) tend
to grow faster than those where the opposite is true (such as Greece).</p>

<h3 class="section__head" id="industry-complexity-index">Industry Complexity Index (ICI)</h3>
<p class="section__p">Ranks industries by the amount of productive capabilities required to
operate. The complexity of industries and exports are closely related, but are
measured through independent datasets and classification systems as exports are
limited to only tradable sectors, while industries comprise all sectors that
generate employment, including the public sector. Industries are complex when
they require a sophisticated level of productive knowledge, such as many
financial services and pharmaceutical industries, with many individuals with
distinct specialized knowledge interacting in a large organization. Complexity
of the industry is measured by calculating the average diversity of locations
that hold the industry and the average ubiquity of the industries that those
locations hold. The formal employment data required for these calculations
comes from the PILA dataset held by the Ministry of Health.</p>

<h3 class="section__head">Formal employment and wages, and formal employment rate</h3>
<p class="section__p">Formal employment is defined as employment covered by the health social
security system and/or the pension system. Formal wages are those reported by
firms to that aim. The formality rate is the share of population 15 or older
that has formal employment. Employment and wage data are taken from PILA.
Population data comes from DANE.</p>

<h3 class="section__head">Industry similarity space</h3>
<p class="section__p">A visualization that depicts how similar/dissimilar the productive knowledge
requirements are between industries. Each dot represents an industry and each
link between a pair of industries indicates that they require similar
productive capabilities to operate. The space illustrates what industries a
location currently has a presence in, and which industries are of a “closer
distance” or require similar capabilities to those existing and are therefore
more likely to be successful. The space presents potential paths for industrial
expansion by understanding how capabilities are shared across industries. Thus,
industries can be understood by the number of links they share with other
products and the complexity of those products. A product with more links offers
greater potential for diversification across shared capabilities. Thus the
number of links that existing industries share to untapped, complex industries
determines its complexity outlook. The Colombian industry similarity space is
based on formal employment data by industry and municipality from the PILA
dataset of the Ministry of Health.</p>

<h3 class="section__head">Metropolitan areas and cities</h3>
<p class="section__p">A metropolitan area is a combination of two or more municipalities that are
connected through relatively large commuting flows (irrespective of their size
or contiguity). A municipality must send at least 10% of its workers as daily
commuters to the rest of the metropolitan area municipalities to be included.
</p>

<p class="section__p">Based on this definition there are 19 metropolitan areas in Colombia, which
comprise 115 municipalities. The resulting metro areas, which are distinct from
official measures except in Medellín’s Valle de Aburrá, are computed with the
methodology of Duranton and Giles (2013): “Delineating metropolitan areas:
Measuring spatial labour market networks through commuting patterns.” Wharton
School, University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class="section__p">In addition to the metropolitan areas there are other 43 cities in Colombia,
defined as municipalities with population over 50,000, with at least 75% of the
population in the main urban area.</p>

<h3 class="section__head" id="product-complexity-index">Product Complexity Index (PCI)</h3>
<p class="section__p">Ranks export products by the amount of productive capabilities required to
manufacture them. A product such as toothpaste is much more than paste in a
tube, as it embeds the tacit productive knowledge (or knowhow) of the chemicals
that kill the germs that cause cavities and gum disease. Complex exports, which
include many chemical and machinery products, require a sophisticated level,
and diverse base, of productive knowledge, with many individuals with distinct
specialized knowledge interacting in a large organization. This contrasts with
low complexity exports, like coffee, which require much less basic productive
knowledge that can be found in a family-run business. <a class="link--stream" href="http://comtrade.un.org/">UN Comtrade</a> data are
used to compute the complexity of export products.</p>

<h3 class="section__head">Product similarity space</h3>
<p class="section__p">A visualization that depicts how similar/dissimilar the productive knowledge
requirements are between export products. Each dot represents a product and
each link between a pair of products indicates that the two products require
similar capabilities in their production. By depicting the similarity in
productive capabilities across products, the product similarity space
illustrates for a location what it currently produces, which products are
“closer” or of a shorter distance in sharing similar capabilities to those
currently existing and are therefore more likely to be successful. The space
presents potential paths for industrial expansion by understanding how
capabilities are shared across products, where products differ in the number of
links and their distance to more complex products. A product with more links
offers greater potential for diversification across shared capabilities. Thus
the number of links that existing products share to complex products that a
location does not currently produce determines the complexity outlook of its
exports.</p>

<p class="section__p">The shape of the space is based on international trade data for 192
countries over 50 years. See <a class="link--stream" href="http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/"> The International Atlas of Economic Complexity.</a></p>

<h3 class="section__head">Strategic Value</h3>
<p class="section__p">Measures how much a location could benefit by developing a particular
industry (or export). Also known also as “opportunity gain,” the measure
accounts for the distance to all other industries (or exports) that a location
does not currently produce and their respective complexity. Strategic gain
quantifies how a new industry (or export) can open up links to more, and more
complex, products. Thus, the measure calculates the strategic value of an
industry (or export) based on the paths it opens to industrial expansion into
more complex sectors.</p>

<h3 class="section__head">Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA)</h3>
<p class="section__p">Measures the relative size of an industry or an export product in a
location. RCA is not a measure of productive efficiency or competitiveness, but
just a “location quotient”, as is often referred to. RCA is computed as the
ratio between an industry’s share of total formal employment in a location and
the share of that industry’s total formal employment in the country. For
exports, RCA is the ratio between the share of the export in the export basket
of the location and its share in total world trade. If this ratio is larger
than 1, the location is said to have revealed comparative advantage in the
industry or export.</p>
